# MouldCare API

Base URL: `http://localhost:3100/api`. All request and response bodies are JSON. Protected endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, obtained from `POST /auth/login`.

- **Errors** are `{ "error": "message" }`, with HTTP status 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 409, 413, or 429.
- **IDs** are opaque strings.
- **Timestamps** are stored and returned in UTC, ISO 8601. Company and plant time zones are IANA identifiers, used for display and scheduling.
- **Dates and times in requests:** a date-only value (`2026-01-01`) means UTC midnight. A date-time must carry a UTC offset (`Z` or `+05:30`) and is rejected without one. The one exception is a contract visit's `dueAt`: a time with no offset, such as `2026-11-15T08:00`, is read in the asset's plant time zone.
- **Money** is stored in minor units (`amountMinor`) with an ISO 4217 currency code.

Route handlers live in `api/routes/`, one module per area. `api/access.js` holds the tenant-scoped lookups that every module uses.

## Access model

| Role | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Platform admin | All tenants; company/provider creation and approval; integration status |
| Dispatcher | All service work; assignment, quotations, parts fulfilment, contracts and visits; in-house staff directory |
| In-house engineer | Only tickets assigned directly to that user; machine data for those assets while the ticket is open |
| Customer admin | Own company setup, assets, contracts, tickets, quotes, devices, audit; manages own plant managers and maintenance staff |
| Plant manager / maintenance | Own company work; plant manager can approve quotes |
| Provider admin / engineer | Only tickets assigned to their provider, and that asset's machine data while the ticket is open; provider admin manages own engineers |

Data scoping and auditing:

- Every ticket, asset, contract, part request, quote, file, and reading is scoped server-side.
- Assignment re-checks the provider's approval, service area, and machine skills.
- IDs from another tenant inside a request are rejected.
- Every change writes an audit event.
- A deactivated user is refused on their next request, even with a token that hasn't expired.

**Sign-in protection.** After five failed sign-ins for the same email from the same address, that combination is locked for 15 minutes (HTTP 429 with `Retry-After`). An unknown email takes as long to reject as a wrong password. The failure counter is kept in memory on each server instance; use a shared store when running several instances.

- mean response time, overall and by priority
- missed response targets
- downtime by asset
- repeat faults over the last 90 days
- upcoming and overdue visits
- contract renewals due within 90 days
- machine-data health

## Workflow rules

**Ticket status**
- The normal path is `open → assigned → accepted → in_progress → completed`.
- `escalated` can be reached from any active status, and returns to `in_progress`.
- A ticket can't be completed without at least one work log.
- Escalating or declining requires a note.

**Declining a ticket**
- Only the assigned engineer or provider can decline, and only before accepting.
- The ticket returns to `open` and unassigned, and the reason is added to its activity.
- The decliner loses access to the ticket, so the reply is `{id, status: "open", declined: true}` instead of the ticket.

**Checklists**
- When a ticket is accepted and its checklist is empty, it is filled from the standard checklist for the asset's machine type (`checklist_templates`).
- Standard checklists are seeded for injection moulding, blow moulding, extrusion, moulds and auxiliary equipment.
- Engineers can add their own items.

**Contract coverage and response targets**
- A ticket is covered by the contract that was active for its asset when the ticket was raised.
- If the contract sets `responseHours`, then `responseDueAt` is the time the ticket was raised plus that target.
- `responseBreached` is true if the ticket was first accepted after `responseDueAt`, or is still unaccepted once it has passed.

**Sign-off**
- Each ticket has one sign-off, given after completion.
- Customers sign in the portal (`method: portal`).
- An assigned engineer or dispatcher can collect it on site by sending `signatureBase64` (a PNG). The signature is stored as a private `signature` attachment, with `method: on_site` and `collected_by`.

**Parts**
- A request moves through `requested → quoted → approved` (or `rejected`).
- After approval it moves through `ordered → shipped → fulfilled`. Steps can be skipped but never reversed.

Examples:

```json
POST /tickets
{"equipmentId":"eq-a","title":"Pressure drops","priority":"high","symptoms":"Drops after warm-up","errorCodes":"E-204","productionImpact":"Line stopped"}

POST /tickets/{id}/assign
{"assigneeType":"provider","assigneeId":"p-atlas"}

POST /tickets/{id}/status
{"status":"declined","note":"No hydraulic specialist available this week"}

POST /tickets/{id}/signoff
{"signerName":"Lee Maintenance","signatureBase64":"iVBORw0KGgo..."}

POST /contracts
{"companyId":"c-acme","title":"Annual care","startsAt":"2026-01-01","renewsAt":"2027-01-01","responseHours":8,"commitments":"Four visits; eight-hour response","exclusions":"Consumables","equipmentIds":["eq-a","eq-b"],"visits":[{"equipmentId":"eq-a","dueAt":"2026-11-15T08:00","notes":"Quarterly inspection (plant local time)"}]}

POST /parts/{id}/fulfilment
{"status":"shipped","reference":"UPS 1Z999AA10123456784"}
```

## Offline actions

The routes marked "works offline" above accept an `X-Client-Action-Id: <UUID>` header.

- The server stores the first result in the same transaction as the change. A replay by the same user returns that stored result without repeating the change.
- Reusing an ID for a different request returns 409.
- The field app queues actions in IndexedDB, shows them on its cached copy of the ticket straight away, and syncs them in order when back online.
- An action rejected by validation stays in the queue for the engineer to review; it is never silently dropped.

## IoT integration interface

Machine data enters through one pipeline, whichever way it arrives:

```text
external API ──pull──▶ adapter.fetchBatch ─▶ adapter.toCanonical ─┐
                                                                  ├─▶ validate ─▶ device→asset mapping ─▶ dedupe ─▶ quality flags ─▶ readings + alarms
external system ──push──▶ POST /integrations/iot/records ─────────┘                  (fail closed)          (device+time)
                                  rejected at any step ─▶ iot_rejections (quarantine, platform-admin review)
```

Code lives in `api/iot/`: `contract.js` (canonical record and validation), `ingest.js` (mapping, dedupe, flags, alarms, freshness queries), `sync.js` (pull runner, cursors, run history), `adapters/` (adapter interface, `mock.js`).

### Canonical record

```json
{
  "deviceId": "demo-device-a",
  "observedAt": "2026-10-01T09:30:00Z",
  "runningHours": 4120.5,
  "cycleCount": 124820,
  "temperatureC": 38.2,
  "alarms": [{ "code": "E-204", "state": "active", "severity": "warning", "message": "Hydraulic pressure below setpoint" }]
}
```

| Field | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `deviceId` | Required, 1-100 chars. Must be mapped to an asset and active, or the record is rejected. The mapping, never the payload, decides the company and asset. |
| `observedAt` | Required ISO 8601 **with offset**; stored as UTC. Rejected if more than 5 minutes in the future. |
| `runningHours` | Optional, 0-1,000,000. |
| `cycleCount` | Optional non-negative integer. |
| `temperatureC` / `temperatureF` | Optional, one or the other; °F is converted to °C at ingest. Plausible range -50 to 600 °C. |
| `alarms[]` | Optional, up to 50. `state` is `active` or `cleared`; `severity` is `info`, `warning` (default), or `critical`. `alarmCode: "X"` is accepted as shorthand for one active warning. |

A record needs at least one metric or alarm. Omitted metrics are stored as null, never as zero.

### Outcomes and data quality

Every record is `accepted`, `duplicate`, or `rejected`:

- **Rejected**: structurally invalid, unmapped device, or inactive mapping. Stored in `iot_rejections` with reasons and the raw payload (truncated to 4 KB), and never attached to an asset.
- **Duplicate**: same `deviceId` + `observedAt` as a stored reading; ignored. This makes pull retries and push replays safe.
- **Accepted, with flags**: plausible-but-suspicious data is kept and flagged in `quality_flags` rather than dropped. Flags: `out_of_order`, `late_arrival` (arrived after the device's stale threshold), `device_clock_ahead`, `cycle_count_regression` / `running_hours_regression` (a counter went backwards, e.g. a controller reset or replacement).

Alarms have a lifecycle: the first `active` opens an alarm at `observedAt`; repeated `active` states are no-ops; `cleared` closes it. No maintenance ticket or alert is generated automatically. That belongs to a later phase, after the source data has been validated.

### Freshness (missing and stale readings)

`GET /equipment/:id/readings` returns an overall `status`:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `unmapped` | No device is mapped to the asset. |
| `inactive` | Mapping exists but is deactivated. |
| `missing` | Mapped, but no reading has ever arrived. |
| `stale` | Latest reading is older than the mapping's `staleAfterMinutes` (default 30, per device). |
| `current` | Latest reading is within the threshold. |

It also returns `metrics.<name>` = `{ value, observedAt, status }` for each metric, where status is `current`, `stale`, or `missing`. A device can keep reporting while one sensor drops out, so each metric's age is shown separately; the UI never presents an old value as current.

### Access

- Readings and alarms are visible to the owning company, to platform admins and dispatchers, and to an in-house engineer or provider **only while they hold an open ticket on that asset**.
- Device mappings are managed by platform admins, dispatchers, and the owning customer admin. Remapping is allowed only within the same company.
- Sync status and quarantine are platform-admin only.

### Push endpoint (server-to-server)

`POST /integrations/iot/records` with header `X-Integration-Key: <MOULDCARE_INTEGRATION_KEY>` and body `{ "records": [ ...1-500 canonical records ] }`. The response is always 200 with per-record outcomes:

```json
{ "accepted": 1, "duplicates": 1, "rejected": 1,
  "results": [ { "index": 0, "status": "accepted", "id": "…", "equipmentId": "eq-a", "flags": [] },
               { "index": 1, "status": "duplicate", "id": "…", "equipmentId": "eq-a" },
               { "index": 2, "status": "rejected", "errors": ["observedAt must be an ISO 8601 timestamp with a UTC offset"] } ] }
```

`POST /integrations/mock/readings` (one canonical record; 201 accepted, 200 duplicate, 400 rejected) is kept for compatibility. The integration key is compared in constant time and never sent to web or mobile clients.

### Pull adapters

An adapter implements `{ name, fetchBatch(cursor) → { records, nextCursor, hasMore }, toCanonical(raw) }`; the full contract is in `api/iot/adapters/index.js`. The runner ingests each batch and stores `nextCursor` in the same transaction, so delivery is at-least-once and deduplication makes it idempotent. If `toCanonical` throws for one record, that record is quarantined and the rest of the batch continues. Each run is recorded in `integration_runs` with its counts and any error.

- Run once: `npm run iot:sync`, or **Run sync now** on the web IoT integration page.
- Poll continuously: start the server with `IOT_SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60` (minimum 15).
- Select an adapter: `IOT_SYNC_ADAPTER` (default `mock`).

The **mock adapter** emits a vendor-style payload (`device.id`, `ts`, `metrics.run_hours`, …), so the mapping step is exercised. Its scenarios: `demo-device-a` reports every 5 minutes, with alarm E-204 raising and clearing; `demo-device-n` went silent 2 hours ago (stale), has no cycle counter (missing metric), and holds critical alarm T-302; the first batch also contains an unmapped device and an out-of-range temperature, and both are quarantined.

### Connecting the real API

Add `api/iot/adapters/http.js` exporting `(env) => adapter`, register it in `adapters/index.js`, and put credentials in server environment variables only. To build it I need: API documentation, sample reading and alarm payloads (including error and empty responses), the authentication method and token lifetime, rate limits and pagination/cursor semantics, the device identifier format, units per field, timestamp and time-zone behaviour, and whether counters can reset.
